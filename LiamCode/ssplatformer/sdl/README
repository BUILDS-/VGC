Basic Readme

This is the template for a genaric side-scrolling video game.

If you've just downloaded this and never compiled before, do the following.
Go to the main directory with all the code (main.cpp Character.cpp, etc).
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

To compile, go into the build/ folder and type the commands:
make clean
make

Then an executable called "main" should appear in the build folder. Run that.

IF SOMETHING SHOULD FAIL AT THIS POINT, DON'T PANIC.
Simply contact a VGC or Builds member familiar with cmake.

main.cpp: 
This is the command flow for the code. Also where collision detection and
gravity functions are.

Character.cpp:
This is where a character (right now, THE character) functions are. This keeps
track of where the character is and the actions it cand do (move, jump, etc).

level.cpp
This is what stores what's in the level. (Characters, terrain, etc).

types.h
This is where the various structs and types are declared.

consts.h
This is where the global defines are.


------------------------TO DO-------------------------------

Next step:

Have the camera focus on the main character.

Have terrain of SOME kind. 
(I know I shouldn't be thinking of stairs right now, but holy fuck those are 
going to be hard)

Bugs to fix:

The current method of just subtracting the screen height by every y value is not
sustainable. Better to convert the core math.

Also, collision detection only works with the main character. Find a way to
make it work with the objects too. (so that two objects can collide).

Does not land exactly at 40 pixels when jumping.

Formatting:

Create a seperate function for each frame

Don't move every 15th frame. Make acceleration a double.

frame overflow fix.

DON'T PUT INCLUDES IN THE HEADER. PUT THEM IN THE SOURCE FILE.

STRUCTS FUCK YOOOOOOOOU (make a good constructor for them)

REMEMBER, SDL HAS THE ORIGIN AT THE UPPER LEFT OF THE SCREEN
