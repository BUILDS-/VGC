Basic Readme

This is the template for a genaric side-scrolling video game.

To compile, go into the build/ folder and type the commands:
make clean
make

Then an executable called "main" should appear in the build folder. Run that.

IF SOMETHING SHOULD FAIL AT THIS POINT, DON'T PANIC.
Simply contact a VGC or Builds member familiar with cmake.

Main.cpp: 
This is the command flow for the code. Also where collision detection and
gravity functions are, but those should be moved out pronto.

Character.cpp:
This is where a character (right now, THE character) functions are. This keeps
track of where the character is and the actions it cand do (move, jump, etc).

Level.cpp
This is what stores what's in the level.


Things to do:
Bugs! Collision detection is wonky. One it needs be executed when the character
is moving and not just when the player has his/her finger on an arrow key.

Second, collision detection is inefficient. Someone should whittle it down to
one function or a few smaller functions.

Also, the code currently runs very slowly on Linux. Finding a fix for that if we
want to work in openGL is a must.
