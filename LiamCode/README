Basic Readme

This is the template for a genaric side-scrolling video game.

To compile, go into the build/ folder and type the commands:
make clean
make

Then an executable called "main" should appear in the build folder. Run that.

IF SOMETHING SHOULD FAIL AT THIS POINT, DON'T PANIC.
Simply contact a VGC or Builds member familiar with cmake.

Main.cpp: 
This is the command flow for the code. Also where collision detection and
gravity functions are, but those should be moved out pronto.

Character.cpp:
This is where a character (right now, THE character) functions are. This keeps
track of where the character is and the actions it cand do (move, jump, etc).

Level.cpp
This is what stores what's in the level.


------------------------TO DO-------------------------------

Next step:

Have the camera focus on the main character.

Have terrain of SOME kind. 
(I know I shouldn't be thinking of stairs right now, but holy fuck those are 
going to be hard)

Bugs to fix:

There is an odd bug where if the character is touching an object on it's right
or left side, it jumps up much, much faster. This is mirrored when the player is
on top of another object, where the player will go left and right at higher
velocity (unconfermed). This probably has to do with how collision detection
screws with velocity.

Fuck that, it's more than that. Jump around for a while and you'll see it. Fix it.

Also, the code currently runs very slowly on Linux. Finding a fix for that if we
want to work in openGL is a must.


Formatting:

Collision detection is inefficient. Someone should whittle it down to
one function or a few smaller functions.

Also make everything switch statements rather than if else

Header file for main.h should have functions.

STRUCTS FUCK YOOOOOOOOU (make a good constructor for them)

CMake:
The Libraries you include specify exact file paths and that's a no no.
Macs and Windows don't use the same file system as Linux and this will cause
problems.

REMEMBER, OPENGL HAS THE ORIGIN AT THE LOWER LEFT OF THE SCREEN
